here 's the story ... chapter 1 being in love with someone who can never love you back is truly pathetic . i look in the mirror every day and tell myself those words over and over again . they flip off my tongue in nasty shame and puking disgust . i hate being pathetic . yet , there is something special and pure about a love that does n't expect anything back
talon saw that one was for him , one for sunshine , and one for ash . crossing the room , acheron pulled the letters down , opened the one addressed to talon and read it out loud . '' ` you did n't listen to me , celt . i warned you to keep her in your swamp where she would be safe . '' ` i 'll bet it 's now tearing you up that you do n't know when , where , and how i 'm going to kill her
he heard a world of hurt in her voice . `` come here , uncle jack 's got you now . '' he gathered her into his arms and she eagerly went to him , nestling her face against his neck . `` we 're going to find your mama and then we 're getting out of here , all right ? '' he heard a single footfall in the grass behind him
it would only feed the blaze for those who thought me guilty , even without a bit of evidence to back it up . lissa , gavin , drake and drew were waiting for us when we arrived at the space station on le-ath veronis . lissa hugged me the moment i walked through the doors . `` do n't let them hurt you , '' she said softly . it was too late for that , but i appreciated her words anyway . `` there are a few reporters in casino city , but we 're going past that
she leaned in like we were coconspirators and whispered , `` i actually uncovered the real scriptures a long time ago , but i changed them to my liking , and then pretended the ones i altered were the newly uncovered ones . the prince has believed you to be the real threat , not me . the true scriptures state that if the female wolf arrives in hell a new reign shall begin . they think you are that reign , but of course , that 's not true-i am the new reign . you are here to ensure that i ascend to the throne , and of course , to give me your magic . it has all been fairly easy to orchestrate , but it 's taken much too long
he would have told her that the moon was just some kind of unusual tropical fruit if it would have calmed her down , and meant it , as best he could . she sniffed . `` that 's the trouble with you young people , '' she said . `` you think because you ai n't been here long , you know everything . in my life i already forget more than you ever know
alonso served northern italian food at the restaurant , since that was what the world wanted now , but as for the old man , he liked his meatballs and red gravy . his own sons lived in california . his daughter was dead from drugs when she was fourteen . he pointed to her picture once and that was the last of it . he would sneer and wave his hand at the mere mention of his sons
`` no , i could never , not feel again , '' i agreed . `` if i had been anyone else 's child i 'm sure they would have killed me outright , but all of their plans would have been ruined for the next century if they had done so . '' i could n't resist the urge to brush a strand of golden hair back from bethany 's face as she turned toward me . i would be devastated without her , but i knew i would never be as hollow as i had been before her . i could barely recall the emptiness that had been my life before her , the black hole that had been my inner workings before she had walked into my life , and i never wanted to experience it again , no matter how miserable my life would be without her
`` and you think if i made a different choice , perhaps with a ` verb ' cowboy like yourself , i 'd be so much better off ? '' she plated another piece of pie and handed it to me . i inhaled . i exhaled . i repeated . i needed to make sure i really wanted to say it
i turn back to the window . across the alley , christina and fernando are trying to lift the ladder back onto the windowsill . though my arms and hands ache , i lean out the window and grab the other end of the ladder , lifting it back onto the windowsill . then i hold it in place as christina crawls across . this time the ladder is more stable , and christina makes it across the gap without trouble . she takes my place holding it as i shove the trash can in front of the door so no one else can come in
sanders studied the crowd . in their seats , everyone had gone still . something was happening , something out of the ordinary . sanders seemed to realize this as well , and perhaps in anticipation , he seemed to choke up . he brought a forefinger to his lips before going on . `` just one more day , '' sanders said again , letting the words hang before going on
adam cuts him off , looking around . `` i ca n't believe this is happening . you 've all lost your minds . you 're all insane , '' he says , gripping the back of his head . `` this guy is a psycho-he 's a murderer - '' `` adam , '' i try to say . `` please - '' `` what 's happened to you
donnie nodded . `` how could i ever be sure if she likes me or the fact that i own this hotel ? '' `` why on earth would you tell her you own sapphire bay before you got to know her ? '' `` i did n't tell her , you did . '' `` i did n't tell her that you own the hotel
cade 's amused face looked away from me , and my eyes drifted shut . `` do you mind , mr. taylor ? the next thing i knew i was in the air and i was flying . i leaned to my left , and there was the side of garrick 's face . it was such a pretty side of a face . my arm was around his shoulder , and together , he and cade were carrying me
nick snorted . he threw the car in park , then turned it off and sat back , his hands on the wheel . `` intergalactic tea-loving time travelers trying to help the british win the revolutionary war . pissed-off historians in an attempt to liberate artifacts from their cages . or treasure hunters out to find the missing knights templar library . '' kelly laughed and leaned his head against the cool glass of the window , pointing a mocking finger at nick
jamie just squeezed his hand . anna and jeff both stood up as chase and jamie approached . chase eyed jeff warily , resisting the urge to rub his jaw where jeff had decked him . jeff seemed relaxed , but the tension in the corners of his eyes betrayed his nerves . anna had always worn her heart on her sleeve , so chase could easily see that she was every bit as nervous as he was . chase shook jeff 's hand , then turned to anna
`` soon , you will understand what a gift i can be . then you will beg me , '' he licked his lips , `` you will beg me not to stop . '' a detached calm settled over kaylee 's mind as miguel turned his attention downward again , and she ceased her struggling against him . he fumbled awkwardly at his trousers . the grip of his injured , likely very painful , arm loosened on her bound wrists , and the unfastened belt slipped . kaylee looked up , passive expression on her face as she noted the slackened grip on her wrists
she stammered for a response , but before she could find the right words and approach , the handyman intervened . `` hey , geoff , you 're a nice kid , but that 's no way to talk to your mom , '' travis walker pointed out from under his furrowed brow . the boy 's head snapped around at the man 's understated , yet unmistakable authority . morgan could see that the handyman 's opinion already mattered to her son . `` it 's just that she 's usually not home this early , '' geoff stammered in explanation to travis
the brightness of the light ebbed a bit . `` everything has some truth in it , thomas , '' the light said without really answering his question , but it made sense to mcdougal . he drew his knees into his chest and tried to shrivel up . `` i 'm thinkin ' we 're in a lot of trouble , '' he whispered to abe , and closed his eyes . `` you are not in that much trouble yet , '' the light said in a solemn but threatening tone . `` but if you do not take action to change your habits very soon we will be sorely tempted to change them for you
`` and you 're the idiot , '' avalon nudged me with his hand , pushing me in the direction we needed to continue to walk . `` i just thought that ... i mean he did n't even let me thank him for the night of the dance , '' i referred to the fight on the gymnasium rooftop . it had happened over two weeks ago , and kiran had yet to say even two words to me . `` told you . he 's the bad guy , '' avalon picked up his pace , and i had to run to keep up with him
