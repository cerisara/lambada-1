he was small , even for a dwarf , and his poor taste in sorcerous robes contrasted awkwardly with d’jebee 's elegant attire ; her long , diaphanous gown and his chemical-stained , star-spangled robe clashed almost as much as her vacuous expression alongside his own visage , alive as it was with cunning and a twisted intelligence . d’jebee sighed with boredom . ` what is it , my love ? ' poldanyelz oozed with ersatz concern . ` i 'm bored , ' d’jebee complained undiplomatically . ` no one ever comes here . i never see anyone except you . ' a shuffling from the main arch alerted her to the inaccuracy of her statement

members of the audience could be forgiven for thinking that a lone man sitting cross legged and smoking on stage with others in front of him singing curious songs looked a bit like a hippie . then the show got under way . sycko happily retired from the stage and master jeremiah entered to a rapturous applause looking resplendent in his frock and sacred top hat . `` ladies and gentlemen , dryvellers , dear guests , '' jeremiah said . it is the greatest pleasure to have you all here with us tonight and i 'm sure you 're going to have a wonderful time , in every sense of the word wonderful

i sat at the back , let down a kneeler , and slid down on it . i was hoping to bring order to chaos . i 'd promised martin to stay with him , when we married . i loved him . but he was - a bad guy . or , at the very least , a not-so-good guy
in addition to other karou-related favors esther had performed for brimstone over the years-enrolling her in schools , faking identity documents for her , etcetera-she 'd been instrumental in setting up her many bank accounts , and surely knew karou 's net worth better than karou did herself . `` lesson one : we do n't worry about how our fruit sculptures are built . we just eat them .

luther pulled out his own medical kit and wiped the area around her hip with more antiseptic before applying a topical antibiotic . `` we realized it is n't necessary for the woman to be attracted to the man-only that the man wants her .

women who used wit to keep men at a distance usually had a sharp edge to them , but somehow with her , it came across as almost ... well , charming and good-natured . maybe it was the accent . the way she sang her words , she could probably talk a cat into swimming across the river . no , he corrected himself , it was n't just the accent
`` it 's your choice , my boy . purged now or the sinner 's fire for eternity . which shall it be ? '' ernie did n't answer . `` which shall it be , ernie ? '' still no answer . `` ernie ? '' `` purged now . '' `` i ca n't hear you , ernie
